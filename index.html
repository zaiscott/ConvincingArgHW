            When it comes to stats many players could take this title, for instance Bill Russell has won 11 NBA Finals, or with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar being the leader in most points scored in all nba history. However, those players are rarely brought up when it comes to "who is the real GOAT?". Players like Lebron may be in the conversation because of his accomplishments in his career much like many others so why is MJ still the GOAT? For starters, he has never lost in the finals aswell as having 6 rings to his name, being the only player in NBA history to be able to say that. Secondly, he changed the game of basketball, his signature moves and elite defense revolutionized the game of basketball much like Steph Curry's 3 point shot today. Finally, he has never had to build a super team in order to win. Today, the only way to the top is by building one of these teams, Lebron has done it, Steph, KD, and many more but never MJ. He is the reason other teams need SUPER teams just to beat him. In conclusion, MJ is the GOAT.
