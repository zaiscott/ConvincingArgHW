            When it comes to stats many players could take this title, for instance Bill Russell has won 11 NBA Finals, or with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar being the leader in most points scored in all nba history. However, those players are rarely brought up when it comes to "who is the real GOAT?". Players like Kobe Jordan may be in the conversation because of their accomplishments in thier career much like many others so why is LBJ the GOAT? For starters, when it comes to stats, he is nearly in the top 10 in every category, of points, assists, steals, rebounds, tripple doubles, ect. He also has won multiple NBA championships and defeated the "greatest team of all time" by himself with a terrible cavs team. He is one of few players where when he leaves a team, that team will become a lottery team due to the lack of his talent. He changed the game of basketball, by changing the natural position of SF by revolutionng to posotion to be able to play and do the same as every other position on the court. Finally, he has never had to build a super team in order to win. Today, the only way to the top is by building one of these teams, players like Kobe, Steph, KD, and many more but not Lebron. He is the reason other teams need SUPER teams just to beat him. In conclusion, LBJ is the GOAT.
